title	Interactive effects of response and conflict expectations: the role of STN-cortex interactions							
description	This dataset of X04 work package 2, comprises behavourial read-outs (manual response times) as well as EEG data (n=17) or EEG plus LFP data from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) (n=10) for a combined motor cueing - conflict paradigm from Parkinson's Disease patients receiving deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN. The patients were tested twice (on and off DBS), with order counterbalanced. These data shall reveal crucial insights into STN-cortex interactions for expectation-dependent motor prepatation/re-programming and conflict resolution.
